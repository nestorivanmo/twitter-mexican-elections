The head of the Simpson family, Homer, is not a typical family man. A nuclear-plant employee, he does his best to lead his family but often finds that they are leading him. The family includes loving, blue-haired matriarch Marge, troublemaking son Bart, overachieving daughter Lisa and baby Maggie. Other Springfield residents include the family's religious neighbour, Ned Flanders, family physician Dr Hibbert, Moe the bartender and police chief Clancy Wiggum."}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029697719", "name": "The Simpsons"}}, {"domain": {"id": "46", "name": "Brand Category", "description": "Categories within Brand Verticals that narrow down the scope of Brands"}, "entity": {"id": "781974596157181956", "name": "Online Site"}}, {"domain": {"id": "47", "name": "Brand", "description": "Brands and Companies"}, "entity": {"id": "1106638172182597632", "name": "IGN"}}, {"domain": {"id": "71", "name": "Video Game", "description": "A video game like Overwatch"}, "entity": {"id": "1137878084554596352", "name": "Tales Series", "description": "This entity includes all conversation about the franchise, as well as any individual installments in the series, if applicable.\t\t\t"}}], "text": "@IGN Simpsons Hit and Run, Custom Robo, Tales of Symphonia", "entities": {"mentions": [{"start": 0, "end": 4, "username": "IGN"}]}}, "includes": {"users": [{"name": "Ryan Kearns", "public_metrics": {"followers_count": 19, "following_count": 93, "tweet_count": 3513, "listed_count": 0}, "id": "333691890", "description": "Bachlors degree in TV/Video Production, Photographer", "username": "Ryan_E_Kearns", "protected": false, "created_at": "2011-07-11T22:56:51.000Z", "verified": false}]}, "matching_rules": [{"id": 1401668264036548617, "tag": "Fraude - Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n"}, {"id": 1401668264036548613, "tag": "Fraude - Nuevo Le\u00f3n"}]}
