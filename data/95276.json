The head of the Simpson family, Homer, is not a typical family man. A nuclear-plant employee, he does his best to lead his family but often finds that they are leading him. The family includes loving, blue-haired matriarch Marge, troublemaking son Bart, overachieving daughter Lisa and baby Maggie. Other Springfield residents include the family's religious neighbour, Ned Flanders, family physician Dr Hibbert, Moe the bartender and police chief Clancy Wiggum."}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10028268905", "name": "Los Simpsons"}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10028414416", "name": "Os Simpsons"}}, {"domain": {"id": "3", "name": "TV Shows", "description": "Television shows from around the world"}, "entity": {"id": "10029697719", "name": "The Simpsons"}}], "text": "En mi casilla votaron por Bart Simpson XD\n\nNo adjunto voto porque no puedo tocar los papeles \ud83d\ude2a"}, "includes": {"users": [{"name": "\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc30CELESTE MARIAN\ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udc99", "public_metrics": {"followers_count": 1022, "following_count": 3105, "tweet_count": 29395, "listed_count": 10}, "id": "541170168", "location": "Riedlingen, Deutschland", "description": "~ They've been sayin', \"You're sophisticated\"\nThey're complainin', overeducated\nYou are saying all the words I'm dreaming ~\n\nAlonsista \ud83c\udfc1\ud83c\udfce\ud83d\udc96 / \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9c / \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc0d / \ud83d\udc36", "username": "Little_Bastard3", "protected": false, "created_at": "2012-03-30T19:55:33.000Z", "verified": false}]}, "matching_rules": [{"id": 1401668264036548615, "tag": "Nuevo Le\u00f3n"}, {"id": 1401668264036548614, "tag": "Monterrey"}]}
